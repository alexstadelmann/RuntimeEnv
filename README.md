# Runtime Environment for L5, a logical programming language
### Basic:
* The objective of this project was to write a compiler and runtime environment for L5 programs, where L5 is a version of pure ProLog.
* Source files in the L5 language need to end with ".l5"
* Every clause needs to be in a seperate line.
* One clause must be written in exactly one line. Empty lines are allowed, too.
* The xecutables in this repository are intended to work on Windows.
* Using GHC, the Haskell source files (Main modules) may be executed on any operating system.

### ML:
